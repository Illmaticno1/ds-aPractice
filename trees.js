// Trees
// a full tree = a tree that has all pointers connecting to a node or no nodes at all.
// a perfect tree = every line is filled all the way across (all node's pointers point to a node)
// a complete tree =
// each node has a parent child relationship.. each node has at most one parent but can have multiple children.. the root no is only a parent
// a node that doesnt have any children is called a leaf node
// Binary Search Tree = every item to the left of each node has a lesser value than its parent and every item to the right has a greater value than its parent.
// BST Big O -
// lookup, insert, remove = O(log n) unless all items are greater than or less than the last which would make searching O(n)
// lookup is better on a BST because O(log n) is faster than the O(n) for linked list
