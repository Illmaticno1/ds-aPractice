// hash tables
// hash table in objects have a key value pair
// the key has to be a string which has to be unique and is put in a hash generator which calculates the address in memory
// hash is a one way operation which means you cant take the memory address and find the key or value
// hashes are deterministic meaning the hash will always produce the same number for the memory address
// collisions happen when separate keys are hashed and mapped to the same memory address
// how to handle collisions (two most common ways are linear probing and separate chaining)
// separate chaining - adding each item mapped to a single memory address to an array or to a linked list
// linear probing - if multiple key value pairs are mapped to the same memory address it checks for the next available slot and maps it to that location (open addressing)
// it is more optimal to have a more randomized distribution of items you add to the hash table if you have a prime number of items
